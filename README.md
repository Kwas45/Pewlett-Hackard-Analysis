## Pewlett-Hackard Summary
As per the retirement employee count, there will be over 90,000 vacancies that will need to be filled. More than half of the vacancies will be from the Engineering department. This will need prioritization. With 1,549 employees versus the 90,000 set to retire, there may not be enough retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation. Pewlett-Hackard will need to address this. Queries can be set, which will closely monitor mentor employees and retirement employees each year to better allocate the necessary resources in order to prevent huge variations.
